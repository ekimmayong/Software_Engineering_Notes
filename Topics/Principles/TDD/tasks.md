# TDD Tasks

1. Practice the red-green-refactor cycle with a small function (e.g., palindrome checker).
2. Write tests for an existing module and refactor the implementation to make tests pass.
3. Add integration tests that exercise multiple components (e.g., a CLI command that reads a file and outputs results).
