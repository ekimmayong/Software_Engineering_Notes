# SOLID Tasks

1. Refactor a class that mixes persistence and business rules into SRP-compliant classes.
2. Add a new Formatter to the OCP example without changing the existing formatter classes.
3. Identify a violation of LSP in a codebase and fix it by redesigning the inheritance.
4. Split a broad interface into smaller ones for ISP.
5. Replace direct instantiation of dependencies with constructor injection for DIP.
