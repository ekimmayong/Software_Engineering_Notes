# KISS â€” Keep It Simple, Stupid

- Definition: KISS advocates for simplicity in design and implementation.
- Discussion: Prefer straightforward solutions that are easy to understand and maintain. Simplicity reduces bugs and onboarding time for new developers.

  Example (Python):

  ```python
  # simple and clear
  def add(a, b):
      return a + b
  
  # avoid unnecessary cleverness
  # bad: lambda chaining or obscure one-liners when a clear function suffices
  ```
