# Software Engineer Learning Notes

This workspace contains a curated, phased learning path and notes to guide a beginner to a career in software engineering. The materials are organized by phases with explanations, definitions, discussions, and example snippets.

Contents

- `software-engineer-learning-path.md` — single-page overview: roadmap, core topics, glossary, resources, projects, and career guidance.
- `Phases/` — phase-by-phase learning materials with detailed topics, discussions, exercises, examples, and projects:
  - `phase-0-mindset-and-tools.md`
  - `phase-1-fundamentals.md`
  - `phase-2-practical-engineering.md`
  - `phase-3-cs-foundations-and-scale.md`
  - `phase-4-specialization-and-career.md`

How to use

1. Pick a phase to start (Phase 0 or Phase 1 recommended for beginners).
2. Read the topic definitions and discussions, try the example snippets, and complete the exercises.
3. Track progress by turning items into checklists or issues in GitHub.
4. Build the projects listed for each phase and publish working demos when possible.

Suggested next steps

- Open this folder in VS Code and review `phase-1-fundamentals.md` to begin coding exercises.
- Create a Git repository (if not already) and commit your progress regularly.
- Choose one programming language and follow the examples in the phases.

Contributing
