# Phase 4 — Specialization & Career (18+ months)

Goal: Choose a specialization, build advanced skills, and prepare for career growth.

## Topics

- System design and architecture at scale
  - Definition: System design is the process of defining the components and interactions of a large-scale software system, considering constraints like latency, throughput, and cost.
  - Discussion: Practice by designing familiar systems (e.g., URL shortener, chat service). Think about data storage, caching, load balancing, failover, and trade-offs. Use simple diagrams to communicate designs.

- Advanced topics for chosen specialization (e.g., frontend performance, backend messaging, ML pipelines)
  - Definition: Specialization topics vary by domain and involve advanced tools and patterns relevant to a career path.
  - Discussion: After general engineering proficiency, pick a specialization and dive deep—learn domain-specific best practices, libraries, and performance considerations. Build portfolio projects that demonstrate depth.

- Leadership and mentorship skills
  - Definition: Leadership involves guiding technical direction and people; mentorship focuses on helping others grow through feedback and coaching.
  - Discussion: Practice giving constructive feedback in code reviews, run small design sessions, and mentor a junior on a project. Develop communication and decision-making skills.

- Interview preparation for senior roles
  - Definition: Preparation for senior interviews includes system design, behavioral readiness, and leadership examples.
  - Discussion: Practice design interviews, prepare stories about impact and trade-offs, and learn to structure answers clearly. Seek mock interviews for real feedback.

## Exercises

- Design and document a large system (capacity planning, trade-offs)
- Mentor a junior developer or contribute meaningful reviews to OSS projects
- Practice system design interviews with peers

## Career steps

- Prepare a portfolio and resume tailored to your specialization
- Network and apply to roles; practice behavioral interviews
- Consider certifications or formal education if it aligns with your goals
