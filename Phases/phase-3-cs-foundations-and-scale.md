# Phase 3 — CS Foundations & Scale (9–18 months)

Goal: Deepen computer science knowledge and learn how systems scale.

## Topics

- Data structures & algorithms (trees, graphs, sorting, searching)
  - Definition: Data structures are organized ways of storing data; algorithms are procedures for operating on that data. Trees and graphs are non-linear structures; sorting and searching are fundamental algorithm classes.
  - Discussion: Focus on understanding how different structures work and why certain algorithms are chosen for particular problems. Implement trees/graphs and practice traversals. Analyze time and space complexity as you implement algorithms.

- Complexity analysis (Big O)
  - Definition: Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's time or space usage as the input size grows.
  - Discussion: Learn to reason about how code performs for large inputs. Start with simple examples (loops vs nested loops) and compute the cost. Use Big O to compare alternative solutions.

- Design patterns and software architecture basics
  - Definition: Design patterns are reusable solutions to common design problems. Architecture covers the high-level organization of a system.
  - Discussion: Study common patterns (factory, observer, strategy) and when to apply them. Focus on clarity and simplicity—avoid premature optimization or over-engineering.

- Concurrency and async programming
  - Definition: Concurrency involves multiple sequences of execution (threads, coroutines). Async programming uses non-blocking operations to improve responsiveness.
  - Discussion: Learn basic concurrency primitives (locks, threads, async/await) and common pitfalls (race conditions, deadlocks). Practice by writing simple concurrent programs and using thread-safe data structures.

- Containers (Docker), CI/CD, performance profiling
  - Definition: Containers package applications with dependencies; CI/CD automates building and testing; profiling helps find performance bottlenecks.
  - Discussion: Containerize a simple service to understand image building and runtime. Add CI to run tests and profiling to identify slow parts of code. Learn basic optimization techniques and measure before changing code.
